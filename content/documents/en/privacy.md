Not in every case all of the aforementioned data categories might be affected or have to be provided. Special categories of personal data (sensitive data) within the meaning of Art 9 GDPR will not processed by Us in the context of this website.

### 3. Processing of Personal Data

Your personal data is processed predominantly for the purposes of performing a contract or for pre-contractual purposes respectively (Art 6 (1) (b) GDPR) – without such data, it would be impossible for Us to prepare, conclude or perform a contract with you (eg a purchase contract concluded in the online-shop). The processing is also carried out for the purposes of legitimate interests of Us or third parties respectively (Art 6 (1) (f) GDPR), including in particular for the purposes of maintaining the operational safety of this website, claims management, direct marketing by analogue and digital means, providing advertisements to existing customers, statistical evaluation and the enhancement of Our services and their quality (please see clause 6. for the right to object in this particular respect). In the case of contacting us via live chat, you also agree to the processing of your disclosed personal data pursuant to Art 6 (1) (a) GDPR (see point 6 concerning the right to revoke such consent).

We will process your personal data only pursuant to the permissible scope of the GDPR. Under normal circumstances, We will not transfer your personal data to third parties. Where this is necessary - e.g. for the performance of a contract (eg to handle payment or shipping) - such transfer will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR. In this case, We ask you to also consult the privacy policies of these third parties as they might become applicable.

An exception to this general rule is the use for statistical and similar purposes. However, this will not involve any personal data but in such cases exclusively anonymized data will be transferred, which do not allow the identification of a natural person and which cannot be attributed to a specific natural person (see also clause 8.).

### 4. Data Security

The protection of your personal data is ensured through organizational and technical measures, including protection against unauthorized access and technical data protection precautions.

Please be aware, however, that notwithstanding these efforts, it cannot be completely excluded that data, which you make available through the internet can be perceived and potentially be used by others. We therefore assume no responsibility or liability for errors in the communication of data or unauthorized access by third parties (e.g. through hacker-attacks, spyware, malware etc).

### 5. Storage of Personal Data

Your personal data will be stored by Us only for the period necessary to fulfill contractual and/or legal obligations (respective obligations may arise, e.g. from fiscal or from product liability provisions). Where the storing is not necessary any longer, such data will be deleted. Notwithstanding the above, a deletion will also take place due to a deletion request made by you (clause 6.).


## 6. Right of Access, Right to Erasure, Right to Withdrawal, Right to Lodge a Complaint

Subject to the existence of statutory confidentiality obligations, you have the right to access your personal data and demand disclosure regarding the source of your personal data, the purpose for which it is being processed and - as the case may be - potential recipients. Furthermore, you have the right to have your personal data rectified, transmitted, their processing restricted or deleted, should the data be incorrect or should the basis for processing personal data cease to apply (Art 15, 16, 17, 18, 20 GDPR).
You also have the right to object to the processing of your personal data based on Art 6 (1) (f) GDPR („legitimate interests“).
We ask you to forward any such claim to office@rothirsch.tech or any contact specified in the imprint of this website.
Please note that a possible objection does not affect the lawfulness of the processing of personal data on the basis of other legitimate grounds listed in Art 6 (1) GDPR.
You have the right to withdraw your consent to the processing of personal data (Art 6 (1) (a) GDPR, Art 7 (3) GDPR). Please note, however, that such withdrawal has no influence on the permissibility of processing personal data on the basis of other legitimate grounds pursuant to Art 6 (1) of the GDPR.
Should you be of the opinion that the processing of your personal data infringes applicable data protection laws or your claims pursuant to data protection laws or otherwise violated, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority (Art 77 GDPR).
