## The red deer

The red deer is our trademark. As a much-hunted creature it is, like us as an IT company, in the constant focus of attackers. We want to protect its living space not only with long-lasting concepts, but also with the use of alternative energies. Our goal will be achieved when we design your project as magnificently as the red deer itself is.

We are pleased to meet you.
