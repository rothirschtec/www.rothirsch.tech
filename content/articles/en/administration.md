# Administration

## 3. Pillar

Monitoring, intrusion detection and prevention, business continuity planning or, for the worst case, disaster recovery planning. A professional company needs a lot of planning, administration and management. You need to think everything through carefully and identify incidents before they occur. All of this depends on the right hardware and software. But you are not alone in this swamp of data and information, we are happy to support and advise you at any time.
