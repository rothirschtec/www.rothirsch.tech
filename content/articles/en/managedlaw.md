# Managed LAW

Data protection has become a major center of attention in the recent past – is your undertaking fully compliant with the requirements set forth by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other data protection laws?

The drastic fines that can be imposed under the GDPR and the associated risks for every undertaking make it necessary to be well prepared and limit risk-exposure as far as possible.

## Managed Law

With the “Managed Law” package, we offer not only a tailor-made privacy policy for your website (including the so called “cookie notice”), but will also provide the details you are legally required to include in the legal information / imprint of your internet presence. This means you don’t have to search the internet for ambiguous “templates” which might not even suit your business and could also constitute a copyright infringement.

But the “Managed Law” package does not stop there – changes in the legal framework will be monitored on a regular basis and applied to your website if necessary. This means your internet presence is always up to date – automatically and with peace of mind.
